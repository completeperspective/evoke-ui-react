# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the 'tree' to get an understanding of the project structure.

If applicable, and the project has not been onboarded with serena, please run the serena onboarding command.

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read the README.md file to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the src/, app/, lib/, or root directory

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.

Explain back to me:

- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Any important dependencies
- Any important configuration files
