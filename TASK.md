## 🎨 **ARCHITECTURE DECISION: CSS Variables Only** - _Revised: 2025-08-23_

### **Decision Summary**

After careful consideration, we decided to **remove the ThemeProvider system entirely** in favor of a pure CSS variables approach. This simplifies the architecture while maintaining all styling capabilities.

### **What Was Removed**

- ❌ **ThemeProvider Component System**: Removed all React context-based theme management
- ❌ **Theme Hooks**: Removed 16 custom theme hooks (useTheme, useThemeColors, etc.)
- ❌ **Runtime Theme Injection**: Removed dynamic CSS variable injection system
- ❌ **Theme Persistence**: Removed localStorage theme management
- ❌ **Emotion Dependencies**: Removed all @emotion packages
- ❌ **10+ Files Deleted**: ThemeProvider.tsx, ThemeContext.ts, useTheme.ts, theme.ts, storage.ts, etc.

### **What Was Preserved**

- ✅ **CSS Variables**: All `--ui-*` CSS variables remain as the foundation
- ✅ **Tailwind Classes**: Components continue using Tailwind utility classes
- ✅ **OKLCH Color System**: Color utilities and OKLCH support maintained
- ✅ **Design Tokens**: Complete token system preserved
- ✅ **Component Functionality**: All atomic components work unchanged

### **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Simplified Architecture**
   - No React context overhead
   - No prop drilling for theme data
   - Cleaner component API

2. **Reduced Bundle Size**
   - Removed ~30KB of theme management code
   - No Emotion runtime dependencies
   - Smaller final bundle

3. **Better Performance**
   - No context re-renders
   - CSS-only theme switching possible
   - Native browser optimizations

4. **Greater Flexibility**
   - Consumers can implement their own theme switching
   - Works with any CSS framework
   - No framework lock-in

### **How Theming Works Now**

```css
/* CSS Variables defined in styles */
:root {
  --ui-color-primary: 0.65 0.19 255.5;
  --ui-color-background: 1 0 0;
}

/* Dark mode via CSS (consumer's choice) */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --ui-color-background: 0.13 0.013 247.86;
}

/* Components use Tailwind classes */
<button className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
```

### **Migration Path for Consumers**

For applications that need theme switching, they can:
1. Use CSS classes or data attributes on `<html>` element
2. Implement their own simple theme toggle
3. Use CSS media queries for system preferences
4. Override CSS variables at any level

            foreground: 'oklch(var(--ui-color-primary-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  };
  ```

### 3. ~~Theme Provider Implementation~~ - **REMOVED** _(Revised: 2025-08-23)_

**Original Implementation (2025-08-22):**
- Initially created comprehensive ThemeProvider with React Context
- Implemented 16 theme hooks and runtime CSS injection
- Added theme persistence and system preference detection

**Architecture Change (2025-08-23):**
- ✅ **Removed entire ThemeProvider system** to simplify architecture
- ✅ **Deleted 10+ theme-related files** including hooks and context
- ✅ **Preserved CSS variables** as the sole theming mechanism
- ✅ **Maintained OKLCH color utilities** for color manipulation

**Rationale:**
- Components already use CSS variables directly via Tailwind
- Removing React context eliminates unnecessary complexity
- Reduces bundle size by ~30KB
- Improves performance by avoiding context re-renders
- Gives consumers full control over theme implementation

## 📝 Notes

- **Package Scope**: Using `@evoke-ui/react` to allow for future framework variants (@evoke-ui/vue, @evoke-ui/svelte)
- **Sass Architecture**: Using SCSS for advanced features like mixins, functions, and better organization
- **Style Bundling**: Styles are compiled and bundled for easy consumption by applications
- **OKLCH Color Space**: Using OKLCH for perceptually uniform color manipulation and better accessibility
- **Tailwind v4 CSS-first approach**: We're using Tailwind CSS v4's new `@theme` directive for better performance and runtime theming
- **shadcn/ui compatibility**: Test each shadcn component with v4 setup, may need slight adjustments
- Start with the token system - it's the foundation everything builds on
- Test theme switching early and often
- Keep components pure and side-effect free
- Document as you build, not after
- Get feedback on the DX early from other developers
- Consider a beta release after Phase 3 for early feedback
- **Migration path**: Provide both v3 preset and v4 CSS config for gradual adoption
- **Style consumption options**:
  - Import compiled CSS: `@evoke-ui/react/styles.css`
  - Import Sass source: `@evoke-ui/react/styles` (for customization)
- **Color benefits with OKLCH**:
  - Perceptually uniform lightness adjustments
  - Predictable color mixing and interpolation
  - Better accessibility contrast calculations
  - Wide gamut support (P3 displays)
