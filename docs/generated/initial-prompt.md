I would like to build a weapon grade ui library in react that can be easily published to npm. I need your help with the high level direction and initial tasks. First, use context7 and the Brave API to search for **Shadcn UI** and Tailwind design systems and learn more about them. We want to build on top of shadcn ui, not try to recreate it. Please follow atomic design principles and focus mainly on the themable design tokens for this iteration. Consuming apps should be able to overwrite css variables at runtime to apply specific brand colors, fonts, and other ui theme customizations.

Then, create a PLANNING.md and TASK.md file.

[PLANNING.md] - high level direction, scope, tech, etc.

[TASK.md]- initial tasks to knock out for project
