## FEATURE:

Implement Phase One from the TASK.md breaking down the tasks into new PRP files. Use INITIAL.md for the format to create new PRPs. STOP after creating the new prps to be executed for review. NEVER commit code before stopping for review.

## EXAMPLES:

Ensure that all paterns are documented and optimized for LLMs to follow established patterns as we build up the code base.

## DOCUMENTATION:

- **Always reference** Context7 to understand best practices when implementing new features
